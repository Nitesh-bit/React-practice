# React Practice

This repository contains practice sets covering almost everything in React, from basics to advanced topics. Just copy the code snippet and paste it into a new CodeSandbox.

# Note

Please note that the App component is already in the code file, so you don't need to add anything. Just copy and paste it into the app component of the new CodeSandbox. Thanks and keep sharing!

Happy REACT ðŸ‘¶!
